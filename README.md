# encrypted-data-component
Creates a react component that holds encrypted data

Usage: Edit createdecrypt.js to the values you want, moving any files necessary into the folder.
Then run `node createdecrypt.js` and the component is output into a file with the same name as the component name.

The component initially shows a screen asking for the decryption password, but then changes into the data when the correct decryption key is provided
